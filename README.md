# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game (non-interactive)


1. The program accepts a single integer argument on the command line representing the board size.
Tic-tac-toe traditionally has a 3x3 board size but your program should support an NxN board where N is
between 2 and 10.
2. The program simulates a game of tic-tac-toe between two computer players, named X and O. The program
randomly selects which player goes first.
3. During each player’s turn, the program randomly places an X or an O in one of the remaining available
squares on the board and puts that player’s mark in that square.
4. If either player fills all the squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally between two corners, that player is the
winner.
5. The game ends when there is a winner, or when all available squares have been filled.
6. Your program should display the name of the player who went first, a picture of the board (use the ‘#’
character to represent unused board squares), and the winner (unless the game is a draw).
